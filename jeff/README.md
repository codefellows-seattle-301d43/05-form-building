# Project Name

**Author**: Jeffrey Weng
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
Aside from just a collection of blogs, I want to make sure that users are also able to write their own blog posts to publish. I also wanted code written in the article to be highlighted for viewing pleasure.


## Getting Started
git clone https://github.com/Inkh/05-form-building

Have node/npm installed.

Run live-server in project directory 'jeff'.


## Architecture
HTML, CSS, Javascript, MarkedJS, HighlightJS, jQuery

## Change Log
09-07-2018 4:40pm - Implemented forms and JSON object for copy.

09-09-2018 7:00pm - Implemented highlightJS for code highlighting. JSON only shows once user presses Publish.

09-09-2018 8:40pm - Implemented MarkedJS so users don't have to use pre and code tags for code blocks.
